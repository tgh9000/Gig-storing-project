# Getting Started

You will need a database called 'cwk'. First you should make sure the postgres server is started (as you did for labs), then connect to the postgres database and create the cwk database:

`CREATE DATABASE cwk;`

You should *not* include a `CREATE DATABASE` statement in your `schema.sql` file. When the system is marked, we will create a database for you.

Make sure the dependencies are installed by running:

`mvn install`

Make sure the run.sh file is executable:

`chmod u+x run.sh`

To run your program (starting with the main method in `GigSystem.java`), you can run:

`./run.sh`

# Getting Started with Testing

We have provided you with a test suite in `GigTester.java`. There is a `testTask` method for each of the tasks, but not all are fully implemented, and you may like to extend the existing ones to think about different cases.

There is no need to submit your `GigTester.java` file, however we strongly recommend that you do write tests. The coursework will be marked using a similar framework to `GigTester.java`. If an option does not work in the test suite, it is likely to score 0 when marked.

There are two data files provided:

* `tests/testbig.sql` - a sample of 50 gigs with randomly assigned acts for usage with tasks 1 to 6

* `tests/testsmall.sql` – a sample of 5 gigs, chosen specifically to help you experiment with tasks 7 and 8

The `tests/testbig.sql` and `tests/testsmall.sql` files do not violate the stated rules, but generating random test data may (and is likely to) randomly violate some of the rules (which you should be able to test).

You can use `run.sh` to populate your database with test data. For example:

`./run.sh reset -f tests/testsmall.sql`

The above command will do the following: 
* Execute `schema.sql` to reset the database schema
* Execute `reset-data.sql` to reset sequences to 10001
* Execute the `tests/testsmall.sql` datafile to load the test data

You can generate some new data (based on a specified random seed) like this:

`./run.sh reset -r 42`

This will generate random data (based on `generateTestDataMain` from `GigTester.java`) - with the file stored in the tmp folder. The filename has the date/time of generation and the seed number supplied so that you can reproduce tests if you need to (i.e. you can reload a file using the "reset -f" method described above). If you supply -1 as the seed, a seed will be chosen for you.

To run testTask1 with the current database state, run:

`./run.sh test 1`

Please note that tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 have sample tests with expected output that is based on the data in `tests/testbig.sql`, whereas options 7 and 8 have expected output based on the data in `tests/testsmall.sql`. If you want to make sure that you’re running with the right data, you could run the reset and the test option at the same time. For example, you can run any of the following:

```
./run.sh reset -f tests/testbig.sql && ./run.sh test 1
./run.sh reset -f tests/testbig.sql && ./run.sh test 2
./run.sh reset -f tests/testbig.sql && ./run.sh test 3
./run.sh reset -f tests/testbig.sql && ./run.sh test 4
./run.sh reset -f tests/testbig.sql && ./run.sh test 5
./run.sh reset -f tests/testbig.sql && ./run.sh test 6
./run.sh reset -f tests/testsmall.sql && ./run.sh test 7
./run.sh reset -f tests/testsmall.sql && ./run.sh test 8
```

Note, resetting the database will not necessarily clear all objects from your database. If you want to be certain that all previous objects have been deleted, you will need to put your own `DROP TABLE`, `DROP VIEW`, etc. statements in your `schema.sql` to make sure you delete everything.

Alternatively, you could `DROP DATABASE cwk; CREATE DATABASE cwk;` but be warned that dropping and recreating the database may cause postgres to run an admin task (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52170028/postgres-database-drop-is-very-slow), which takes a bit of time, so we advise you don’t do that very often. If you really want this every time you reset the database, alter the reset process in `run.sh` to uncomment the line:
`echo "DROP DATABASE cwk; CREATE DATABASE cwk;" | /modules/cs258/bin/psql postgres`

If you want to test anything specific, it is a good idea to generate a file, import it and modify the data in the database. You could then make a copy of your database using this:

`/modules/cs258/bin/pg_dump cwk --data-only > databasestate.sql`

which you can then load again at any time using

`./run.sh reset -f databasestate.sql`

The `reset-data.sql` file (called by run.sh reset) automatically sets all sequences to be 10001. This is to ensure that test data can be inserted with IDs between 1 and 10000. Please make sure that your system does not rely on any values below 10000, as these may contain test data.
